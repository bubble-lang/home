# Welcome to Bubble

Bubble is a fun, easy-to-learn programming language designed for beginners. Let's dive in and start coding with Bubble!

## Your First line of Bubble Code

In Bubble, you can print something on the screen with the say command. Add the text you want to show by using quotations.

```
say "Hello, World!"
```

Run this code and you'll see "Hello, World!" printed to the console. Congratulations, you just wrote your first Bubble program!


<Play initialCode = {`say "Hello, World!"`}/>


## Variables

Variables are like places where you can save information. For example, you can save the value of a number to a variable. In bubble, we can use the `set` keyword.

```
set x to 5
```


We can print the values of `x` and `y` using the say command

```
say x
```


<Play initialCode = {`set x to 5

say x`}/>





You can also combine variables and strings using the `plus` operator:

```
set greeting to "Hello, "
set name to "Alice"
say greeting plus name # Output: Hello, Alice
```

## Conditionals

Bubble supports conditional statements to make decisions in your code. Use `if`, `else`, and `end` keywords to define the structure:

```
set x to 2
if x is greater than 5
  say "x is greater than 5"
else
  say "x is not greater than 5"
end if
```

## User Input

Getting user input is simple with the `input` function. Here's a little number guessing game:

```
set name to input "What is your name? "
say "Hello, " plus name plus "! Let's play a guessing game."

set secretNumber to 7
set guess to input "Guess a number between 1 and 10: "

if guess is equal to secretNumber
    say "Correct! You guessed it!"
else
    say "Sorry, that's not it. The number was " plus secretNumber
end if

say "Thanks for playing, " plus name plus "!"
```
