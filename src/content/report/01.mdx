## Abstract
In this report, I introduce a new programming language for beginners called Bubble. Bubble is aimed to be simple and easy to learn. It is inspired by HyperTalk, Hedy, and Scratch. Bubble aims to bring the joy of programming to beginners and help climb the command line wall (Appleton).

## Executive Summary

### Background

• Bubble is an interpreter written in Go

• It is a text-based programming language with a REPL

• The syntax will be beginner-friendly and help teach basic concepts of programming

### Problems with current situation

• The transition from block-based (e.g., scratch) to text-based programming (e.g., python)
can be challenging,

• Syntax statements and error messages may make it difficult to understand for the user.

• Increased frustration may lead to lack of motivation.

### Proposed solution objectives

• Create a new programming language that uses simple keywords and functions

• Implement a lexer and parser to interpret tokens and output code

• Provide easy to understand error messages

• Distribute the program through GitHub and a new website dedicated for the language


## Introduction


Coding can be one of the most fun aspects of interacting with computers and machines. The
delight that one can feel, the efficacy that motivates, and the joy of creating things through code is truly a modern-day delight. However, for many people, coding is less appealing and can also be frustrating. Moreover, the necessity of code in many areas of work make programming inevitable as more and more jobs rely on technical abilities. While low-code tools have been useful in bridging the gap between programmers and non-programmers, the ability to code can further help users to develop and create applications.

While there are several programming languages and approaches available, there is an opportunity
to create programming languages that are easy to use and beginner-friendly. Block-based
programming such as Scratch make use of visual elements. Text-based programming such as
python have simple syntax and have a rich ecosystem to build versatile applications. However,
between these two approaches and levels of abstraction, there is a gap that has a good balance
between human-like thinking and abstract computer code. Bridging this gap can provide
opportunities to help users have an enjoyable experience learning to code.

In this project, I propose to create a new programming language called Bubble. This language will be an interpreter written in Go. Its goal is to be an useful programming language that can be used to teach beginners how to code. It is a text-based language that tries to bridge the gap between human language and traditional programming syntax. With helpful error messages and visual and textual feedback, bubble hopes to help the beginner through the stages of coding.


### About the Proposed Language: Bubble

• Bubble will be an interpreter written in Go designed for teaching programming to children and beginners.

• It is a text-based programming language. The goal for the language is to be a language that can be used to introduce beginners to text-based programming.

• The language will try to bridge the gap between human language and traditional programming language syntax.

• Additionally, the language will try to minimize user frustration by avoiding common errors such as missing semicolons, or indentations.

### The Need for an Intermediate Language

Block-based programming languages, such as Scratch, have been incredibly successful in
introducing children to coding concepts. These visual environments allow learners to create
programs by connecting puzzle-like blocks, making the process intuitive and engaging. However,
as learners progress, they often face challenges when transitioning to text-based languages.
Moors, Luxton-Reilly, and Denny (2018) highlight this difficulty in their research, noting that
"students often struggle with the syntax and structure of text-based languages after becoming
accustomed to the visual nature of block-based environments" [1]. This transition gap can be
discouraging for learners and may even lead some to abandon programming altogether.
While existing programming languages have their strengths, several issues can make them
challenging for beginners:

### Problems with current programming languages

Common challenges faced by beginners include transitioning from block to text languages,
learning and memorizing syntax and structure, facing cryptic error messages, and thereby as a
result, feeling stuck, discouraged, and abandoning programming.
Syntax rules in many programming languages can be confusing for beginners. For example, the use
of semicolons, indentation, or brackets can be sources of errors and frustration. Altadmri and
Brown analyzed several compilations and found that syntax errors were among the most common
mistakes made by beginners. Errors included confusing assignment with comparison operators,
unbalanced parentheses, incorrect semi-colons, and wrong separators [2].
Similarly, error messages in many programming languages can be difficult for beginners to
understand [3]. This can lead to frustration and discouragement among new learners.

So I thought to myself, can I create a programming language without much punctuation. This was my initial expectation.

### Proposed Solution: Bubble Programming Language

When I was searching for programming languages that bridged the gap between block-based programming and text-based programming, I noticed a lack of languages. I came across languages
such as HyperTalk by Apple which followed English grammar syntax. It relied on text to describe in almost pseudocode-like syntax [4].
Bubble is partly influenced by HyperTalk and maintains some of the simplicity and intuitiveness of block-based languages while introducing text-based approaches that are fundamental to more advanced programming languages.

### Why Go?
Go is a compiled language that is close to C like language syntax. It is an open source language that is easy to learn. It has a robust standard library and a large ecosystem. It can be easily extendable due to the package ecosystem and community of developers. Go has been used to create rich command line tools and applications. This makes Go a very suitable language for Bubble.

### Key Features of Bubble

Bubble incorporates several key features designed to make it accessible and effective for
beginners:

1. Text-based syntax: Unlike block-based languages, Bubble uses a text-based syntax, helping
learners transition to more traditional programming paradigms.

2. Beginner-friendly keywords: The language employs simple, intuitive keywords that are easy
for novices to understand and remember.

3. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment: Bubble includes a REPL, allowing users to input
commands and see immediate results, facilitating experimentation and learning.

4. Simplified error messages: Error messages in Bubble are designed to be clear and helpful,
guiding learners towards solutions rather than causing frustration. They will be brief,
positively toned, constructive, specific, emphasize user control-over system, and
comprehensible [5].

5. Easy installation and use: The language is designed to be simple to set up and use, reducing
barriers to entry for new programmers.

## Implementation

### Go

Bubble will build on go.

The following are the implementation steps.

1. Define keywords and syntax structure

2. Implement a lexer to split input to tokens

3. Create a parser to interpret tokens and generate executable code

4. Create an interpreter to run the program


### Keywords & Syntax Structure

Bubble's design philosophy centers around simplicity and clarity.

| keyword | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| set     | assign a variable |
| print   | print a variable  |
| if      | conditional logic |
| else    | conditional logic |
| end     | complete code block |
| repeat  | loop  |
| while   | loop  |
| ask     | prompt input        |

### Lexer

import lp from "../../components/interactive/tp.jsx";

  <lp

        client:load
      />



This is an visualiztion of

import Tokenizer from "../../components/interactive/tokenizer.jsx";

<Tokenizer hideTextBox={true} title="Example" subtitle="plain language is converted to tokens" footnote="this is a react component"
 client:load defaultCode={`set x to 20
set y to 30`} />

This is an interactive component. You can type some code and see the tokenizing happen in real time.

<Tokenizer hideTextBox={false} title="Visualize tokens" subtitle="Type some code here. Try `set x to 10`" footnote="this is a react component"
 client:load defaultCode={`set x to 20
set y to 30`} />

import Parser from "../../components/interactive/parser.jsx";

 <Parser
        title="Bubble Lang Parser Demo"
        subtitle="Watch how the parser builds an AST"
        footnote="This is a simplified demonstration of the parsing process."
        client:load
      />

### Language Design

Bubble's design philosophy centers around simplicity and clarity. The language will support basic
concepts including variables, conditionals, loops, and functions, but with a syntax that is more
intuitive than traditional programming languages.

### Sample Syntax Proposals
To illustrate how Bubble might look, here are three potential syntax styles:
Style 1: Natural Language
create number called age and set it to 25
if age is greater than 21
 print "You are an adult"
else
 print "You are a minor"
repeat 5 times
 print "Hello, World!"
create function called greet with name
 print "Hello, " followed by name
call greet with "Alice"
Style 2: Pseudocode-like
var age = 25
if (age > 21) then
 print "You are an adult"
else
 print "You are a minor"
loop 5 times
 print "Hello, World!"
function greet(name)
 output "Hello, " + name
greet("Alice")
Style 3: Blended Pseudocode and Python-like
age = 25
if age > 21:
 print("You are an adult")
else:
 print("You are a minor")
for i in range(5):
 print("Hello, World!")
def greet(name):
 print("Hello, " + name)
greet("Alice")
Table 1: Comparison of block-based and text-based approaches

Implementation Plan
Tools and Technologies
Bubble will be implemented using the Go programming language. I choose Go for its simplicity and
strong support in the community. I will use the GoLand IDE, which provides excellent tools for Go
development.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies
There are risks in developing programming languages for general wider-use. Some risks include:
1. Risk of deprecation: I hope to add short-term to medium-term support for maintenance
and documentation. To extend to long-term support, I hope to gather community support
and contributions.
2. Support for multiple operating systems: Go has good build tooling that can be utilized to
deliver multi-platform support.
3. User adoption: There is a chance that Bubble will not have enough user adoption and there
is also a chance that there might be too much adoption. To handle high volumes, I will add
more tutorials and documentation and create a forum for community support. In case of
less adoption, I plan to write technical tutorials and blog posts introducing Bubble as a
programming language for beginners, including children and adults new to programming.
Future directions for Bubble
1. Development of a terminal user interface (TUI) specifically designed for Bubble,
incorporating visual aids to support learning.
2. Creation of a curriculum and set of coding challenges to guide learners through
programming concepts using Bubble.
3. Expansion of the language to include more advanced programming concepts as learners
progress.
Conclusion
Bubble represents an innovative approach to addressing the challenges faced by novice
programmers transitioning from block-based to text-based programming. By providing a carefully
designed language with intuitive syntax and helpful error messages, Bubble aims to make the
learning process smoother and more enjoyable for beginners.
As the project progresses, continuous feedback from educators and learners will be crucial in
refining the language and ensuring its effectiveness as a learning tool. With its focus on simplicity
and user-friendliness, Bubble has the potential to become a valuable asset in the programming
education landscape, helping to cultivate the next generation of skilled programmers.
